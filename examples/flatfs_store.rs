//! This example demonstrates using FlatFsStore for persistent content-addressed storage.
//!
//! The example shows how to:
//! - Initialize and configure a FlatFsStore
//! - Store and retrieve structured data
//! - Work with CIDs and content addressing
//! - Handle metadata and content persistence
//!
//! Operations demonstrated:
//! 1. Setting up a persistent store directory
//! 2. Creating and storing structured content
//! 3. Managing content metadata
//! 4. Retrieving and displaying stored content
//! 5. Working with CIDs and references
//! 6. Handling store statistics and codecs
//!
//! To run the example:
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --example flatfs_store -- /path/to/store
//! ```
